- Observe the connected graph has been partitioned into required spaces with the minimum number of connections in between.
- Observe the effect of changing the parameters \(\alpha\) and \(\delta T\) for the annealing schedule.
- Vary the number of nodes and edges and observe if there exists any relation between \(\delta T\) and number of nodes/edges.
